One of the most popular one available is HxD , a free to download Hex Editor with a good variety of features. Furthermore, as you will be working mostly with Base16 number, a way to convert back and forth between Hexadecimal and Decimal numbers is recommended. There are multiple converters freely available online. Technical Terms Endianess The games store numbers using Little Endian, as oppose to Big Endian. Big Endian is what we use to refer numbers, with the most significant digit goes first, and the further along a number, the less significant the digits become. Little Endian, on the other hand, puts the most significant digit last. For example: # Big Endian 256 (Decimal) -> 01 00 (Hexadecimal) # Little Endian 256 (Decimal) -> 00 10 (Hexadecimal) Keep this in mind as you traverse the files searching for a number. Specific Terms Breakdown Throughout the documentation, certain terms will be used to describe certain things. Those terms are as followed: # Normal type byte: 1 byte of data. short: 2 bytes of data. int: 4 bytes of data. float: 4 bytes of data, in float format. String: A series of bytes until the \\x00 (null) character is encountered. # Array type[length]: Consecutive bytes of `type` that is `length` long. If another term is encountered, it will be explained in the same article.
